This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner: Ben Ross (bpross@ucsc.edu)
Partner: Erik Steggall (esteggal@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair
should drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working 
together, and at most 25% of an individual's effor for the 
assignment should be spent working alone. Any work done by 
a solitary programmer must be reviewed by the partner. The 
object is to work together, learning from each other, not 
to divide the work into two pieces with each partner 
working on a different piece.

Ben Ross spent 15 hours working alone
Erik Steggall spent 15 hours working alone
We spent 30 hours working together
Ben Ross spent 15 hours driving
